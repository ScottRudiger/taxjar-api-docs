# Billing

Each sales tax calculation or rate lookup request made to our API results in a "transaction". These transactions will be counted toward your monthly plan limit. Overage fees are charged separately if you exceed your plan limit during busier months. You'll always remain on the same plan until you decide to upgrade. You can check your API usage under "Transaction History" from [Plans &amp; Billing](https://app.taxjar.com/account/plan) in the TaxJar app. Hover over the transaction counts for a breakdown of imported orders and calculations.

[View our pricing](https://www.taxjar.com/pricing/) to find a plan that works best for you. We also recommend our guide on [avoiding unnecessary API calls](/api/guides#avoiding-unnecessary-api-calls) to reduce your API usage and save money.
